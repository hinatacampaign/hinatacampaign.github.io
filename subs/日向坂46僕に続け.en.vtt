I’m going

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:39.998
The world is too vast—where should I head?

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:46.732
No matter who I ask, 
they just shake their heads, not knowing.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:53.065
On the other side 
of this ocean I’ve yet to see,

00:00:53.865 --> 00:01:00.249
What could be waiting there?

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:04.315
They say the sky is covered 
with pitch-black clouds,

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:07.316
That it never clears.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.815
And deep in the thick, dense forest,

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:17.015
It's said that terrifying monsters dwell.

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:24.265
People won't venture toward a future 
they can't imagine themselves,

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:31.428
With rumors and legends, 
they wipe it off the map.

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:37.416
Tomorrow will be a new continent, 
different from today.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:44.399
No matter who tries to stops me, 
I'm setting off now.

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:50.798
I’ll take on all the high waves.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:58.482
Those who have dreams, follow me!

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:08.765
I’m not denying life here,

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:15.483
But isn’t there an 
even more amazing world out there?

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:21.915
Rather than suppressing 
that curiosity and ambition,

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.132
Wouldn’t you rather 
go out and find out for sure?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.865
If a storm rages in that land,

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.199
We’ll wait until the blue skies return.

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:39.266
Hopes we easily wished for

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:42.761
Won’t fall into our hands.

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:46.134
That’s why we move forward,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.116
Because when we’re young, 
we’re allowed to fail that much more.

00:02:53.416 --> 00:03:00.332
No matter how many times we lose our way, 
we can always turn back.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:06.066
Even if tomorrow doesn’t work out, 
the day after tomorrow will still come.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:13.349
Let’s set sail as we please.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:19.666
People won't venture toward a future 
they can't imagine themselves

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:26.766
With rumors and legends, 
they wipe it off the map.

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:32.499
Tomorrow will be a new continent, 
different from today.

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:39.365
No matter who tries to stops me, 
I'm setting off now.

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:45.999
I’ll take on all the high waves.

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:52.616
Those who have dreams, follow me!

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:59.166
Whatever hardship we may face, 
I'll be your shield.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:06.832
Those who have dreams, follow me!
