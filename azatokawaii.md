lyrics: >+
    I was enticed by you

    (In one glance, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    I fell in love of my own accord

    It's not your fault

    Today, I saw you again 
    (Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

    No, I guess I was looking for you

    So many high school girls there 
    (Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

    It was during rush hour

    But you always caught my attention

    The arms of your cardigan

    You made them just a little longer

    And the way you clenched your hands

    Was cunningly cute 
    (Hey!)

    I was completely enticed by you

    (In one breath, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    Even your habit of biting your lower lip

    Somehow everything made my heart flutter

    And when you tilted your head

    (It knocked me out, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    Are you aware that you're being watched?
    (Hey!)

    I'm already hooked on you

    Why do you always catch my eyes 
    (Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

    Even though there are 
    so many girls in this world

    You don't look like a part-time model 
    (Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

    You're just an ordinary person

    But ordinary is what I like

    Even when our eyes meet

    With a puzzled look

    You keep on staring at me

    And your troubled face

    Is cunningly cute
    (Hey!)

    Have you been targeting me the whole time?

    (Be honest, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    Has everything not been unconscious, 
    but planned all along?

    I can't read what's inside your mind

    If I made you sad

    (I'm sorry, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    I don't care at all 
    whether you've been deceiving me (Hey!)

    I love you

    Every gesture and every expression

    I've been led around by your intentions

    I was completely enticed by you

    (In one breath, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    Even your habit of biting your lower lip

    Somehow everything made my heart flutter

    And when you tilted your head

    (It knocked me out, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

    Are you aware that you're being watched? 
    (Hey!)

    I've been hooked by you

    I love you
