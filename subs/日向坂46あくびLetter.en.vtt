00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:16.359
On the mahogany table, 
rewriting the letter over and over again

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:23.358
Tonight, as always, 
my only ally is milk tea

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:31.825
How long have I been 
thinking about that person?

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.724
Even the moon in the night sky 
must have been watching me

00:00:39.257 --> 00:00:45.741
Closing my eyes, biting my lips, 
searching endlessly

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:53.607
For an exit hidden deep 
within the fog of my heart

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.607
Whenever I have sleepless nights, 
I always wonder why I love you so much

00:01:00.797 --> 00:01:08.955
Your smile, your gestures, 
your voice, and even your back

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.089
Dozens, no, hundreds of times, 
I’ve imagined the same things

00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:23.072
And so, until the night breaks

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:31.172
Yawning, I write my love letter

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:44.941
From the hem of the antique curtains
spills the sunrise

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:51.537
I wanted to confess, but I ran out of time

00:01:52.186 --> 00:02:00.103
Surely, I could never love anyone else

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:07.186
Even the little birds nearby 
chirp in agreement

00:02:07.453 --> 00:02:14.119
Lying on a bed without a single wrinkle

00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:21.835
With just the lingering warmth 
of the wood stove, I feel happiness

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:29.036
When sleep finally comes, I’ll 
unknowingly dream of my wishes fulfilled—

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:37.335
Strolling with arms linked, 
down an avenue of trees on the weekend

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.985
Sitting on a bench somewhere

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:44.401
All the feelings I’ve kept hidden 
until that day

00:02:44.668 --> 00:02:52.650
I'll gently reveal them in a love letter

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:18.949
Anyone who falls in love loses sleep, 
don’t they?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.148
How many more long winters must pass?

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:34.215
Whenever I have sleepless nights, 
I always wonder why I love you so much

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.548
Your smile, your gestures, 
your voice, and even your back

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:49.748
Dozens, no, hundreds of times, 
I’ve imagined the same things

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:56.664
And so, until the night breaks

00:03:57.547 --> 00:04:04.676
Yawning, I write my love letter
