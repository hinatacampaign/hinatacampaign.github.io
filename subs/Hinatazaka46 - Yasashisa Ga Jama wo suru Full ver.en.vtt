00:00:02.204 --> 00:00:06.037
I won't take advantage of your kindness

00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:09.487
I heard you talking to yourself

00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:14.354
The love that will end in my arms

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.270
I held it once more

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:29.868
Nothing has changed

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:33.603
Sunlight streams through the shade

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:37.919
And morning comes with chirping birds

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:41.451
On the sofa, we leaned close

00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:45.235
Sharing our loneliness

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.035
We talked about the future

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.735
One thing at a time on that night

00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:57.218
Dreams always exist

00:00:57.485 --> 00:01:00.735
Somewhere far from here

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:05.018
If we stay together

00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:07.901
They’ll surely never come true

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.434
Your kindness gets in the way

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:16.284
I know you're trying to be strong

NOTE Paragraph

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.564
It would be better for you if I didn't stop you

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:27.747
If it would make you happy

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.663
I'd endure any sorrow

00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:35.496
My eyes are moist

00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:42.396
Before they burst into tears

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:46.629
Wooh…

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:54.862
This might be the last time I ever taste Kilimanjaro coffee

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:58.712
That tang you loved

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:02.145
I'll never forget it

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:05.728
I didn’t want you

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:10.394
To live a life of regret

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:14.310
So I can only smile

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:17.493
And see you off

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.943
Selfishness and consideration

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:25.894
Are playing a tug-of-war in my heart

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:29.643
The thought of losing you

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.210
Doesn't feel real to me

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.494
Biting my lip,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.309
I hold back my whining

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.409
If your dreams come true

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:57.381
I’ll bear with it, wooh…

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.088
You walk slowly towards the door.

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:16.183
Even if you're waiting for me

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:20.782
I won't chase after love's back

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:26.552
I won't take advantage of your kindness

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.247
I heard you talking to yourself

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:34.969
The love that will end in my arms

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:38.002
I held it once more

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:42.351
Your kindness gets in the way

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:46.334
I know you're trying to be strong

00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:53.601
It would be better for you if I didn't stop you

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:58.317
If it would make you happy

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:01.650
I'd endure any sorrow

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.434
My eyes are moist

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.817
Before they burst into tears

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:21.049
Wooh…
