WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.195
Day off~~~

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:04.138
Why don't we do a secret live show?

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:05.217
Just us?

00:00:05.217 --> 00:00:06.490
Let's do it!

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.162
Oh, sounds good!

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:09.664
You really wanna do it??

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.357
We'll need costumes

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:16.793
What about my place's rooftop?

00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:17.513
Sounds good!

00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:18.803
I wanna wear cute costumes!

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:19.503
Okay!

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:21.698
Better hurry, girls
I'm picking out clothes lol

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:22.418
Crazy lol

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:23.278
Where are you now?

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:23.988
I'm going too!

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:29.850
In this world, as many stars as there are,

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:37.981
There are just as many men,
but where do I compromise?

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:44.173
Chasing ideals only leads to heartbreak

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:51.700
I'd rather have modest happiness

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:59.739
Finally, as I grow up, I've learned that

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:05.517
I need to broaden my horizons

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:13.344
I don't like men 
who are popular with girls

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:20.495
Rather than attractiveness, 
not getting hurt is more important

00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:27.572
If the competition is fierce, 
I can't relax

00:01:27.718 --> 00:01:30.972
I'd rather have someone 
I can have all to myself

00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:37.475
Even if he's just an 
ordinary face in the crowd

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.337
I used to think love was 
about being swept off my feet

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:55.216
And working hard for it, 
but I'm exhausted

00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:59.505
More than that, whenever I turn around,

00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:03.167
someone who's always there

00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:08.681
That's the kind of man I want

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:16.887
If I can find just 
one person like that in this world

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:23.920
Someone kind who loves only me

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:31.053
Looks don't matter,
what's inside is what's important

00:02:31.182 --> 00:02:36.792
It's easier without any rivals

00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:44.401
I like the face-in-the-crowd type, 
wo, wo, wo

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:52.150
I finally realized it, 
wo, wo, wo

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:59.003
Someone who stirs jealousy in others

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:06.108
I don't need a perfect man like that

00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:12.726
But someone who's always close to me

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.131
I love you

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:24.098
I don't like men 
who are popular with girls

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:31.181
Rather than attractiveness, 
not getting hurt is more important

00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:38.153
If the competition is fierce, 
I can't relax

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:43.525
I'd rather have someone 
I can have all to myself

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:48.320
Even if he's just an 
ordinary face in the crowd
