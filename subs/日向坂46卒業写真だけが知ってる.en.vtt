00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.699
How many times have I seen the cherry blossoms?

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:50.598
Petals are dancing in the wind and scattering.

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:56.766
Whenever this season comes around,

00:00:57.498 --> 00:01:02.182
For some reason, I feel so wistful.

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:05.265
Is it the season of endings?

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.597
Or is it the season of beginnings?

00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:11.365
When I look back later,

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:14.280
Everything will be a "rewrite" of memories.

00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:17.681
The one thing I'll never forget is

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:21.231
That spring day when I met you.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:28.247
Only the graduation photo knows,

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:31.447
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, I loved you—

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:33.963
How much I loved you.

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:42.612
If only I had confessed back then,

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:49.745
Would you be by my side now?

00:01:52.908 --> 00:02:04.005
In our last classroom, 
you were taking selfies with everyone on your phone,

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:10.214
Saying, "Our youth has come to an end."

00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:15.045
I still remember that.

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:22.278
Each of our lives splits into countless paths,

00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:27.628
But back then, without knowing anything, I waved goodbye,

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:35.344
I never thought that would be our real goodbye...

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.761
Every time I open the graduation photo,

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.910
Even now, even now, even now, even now,

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:47.310
My heart feels tight.

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:56.026
In the third row on the left, you're smiling.

00:02:56.358 --> 00:03:03.543
Even now, I still love you.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:23.825
Only the graduation photo knows,

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.908
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, I loved you—

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.441
How much I loved you.

00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:37.974
If only I had confessed back then,

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:45.191
Would you be by my side now?

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:48.190
From back then until now, yeah, yeah,

00:03:48.473 --> 00:03:51.256
Nothing has changed, yeah, yeah.

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:56.123
I'll love you forever, yeah, yeah.

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:08.806
"Even though I loved you too..."
