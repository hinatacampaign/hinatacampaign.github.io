00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.990
<i>Unreleased Geki-rare 
(Extremely Rare) Talk!</i>

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.634
<i>First, Watanabe Miho-san will share a Geki-rare story 
she has never revealed to the media before!</i>

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.810
Watanabe-san, this is your 
first time on <i>Geki-rare</i>, right?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.600
Yes, it's my first time. 
Nice to meet you!

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.830
Nice to meet you, too!

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.760
Watanabe-san and Wakabayashi-san 
worked together for a long time.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.570
That's right.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.840
What do you think about 
Wakabayashi-san in <i>Geki-rare</i>?

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.880
Well...

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.840
What are you laughing at?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.210
You laughed at an inappropriate moment!

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.470
We worked together for 4 years.
-Yes, on the Hinatazaka show.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.610
We see each other regularly.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.884
But after I quit being an idol, 
I only meet him once in a while.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600
I'm a little embarrassed now.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.270
I see.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.370
I'm a little nervous.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.800
But I'm so happy to see him now. 
It feels reassuring.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.000
You are reliable.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.869
I'm grateful.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.488
You must be happy.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.580
Wakabayashi-san, what do you think of Watanabe-san?

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.690
In that other show, Watanabe-san was part of the second generation.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.850
I thought she would become the main focus.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.450
But she suddenly quit being an idol.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.080
She suddenly graduated!

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.880
You said it like I did something bad!

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.210
No, you didn't!

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.610
That's right.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.150
She can do many things.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.300
Like Kasuga, she's good at sports.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.850
And there's a lot of memorable scenes 
where she fights with Kasuga.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960
So you're good at sports!

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.790
She didn't lose to Kasuga in strength.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.510
She's powerful.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.480
I think of him as a rival.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.624
Watanabe-san, have you ever 
had a rare experience?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.830
Well...

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.400
I don't think many people 
have had this experience.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.164
I quit university after only two days.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.570
Is that so?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.670
Yes.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
I've never talked about this 
in public before.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.376
I became an idol in the 
summer of my third year of high school.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
It was in the middle of 
the entrance exam period.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.442
My parents wouldn't approve of me 
being an idol if I didn't go to university.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.200
So I enrolled to university.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.995
However, I thankfully became 
so busy with my idol activities.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.688
So after two days, I thought 
I couldn't continue on with university.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.480
It broke my heart.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.970
And I quit university after two days.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.740
Why did you only tell me this story now?

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.390
That's right!

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.450
It's a very good story!

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.670
It's a story from six years ago.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.060
While you were an idol, had you ever thought
back that you quit university in two days?

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.620
I did! -You never said it!

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.594
I thought about it all the time!
I feel bad about it.

00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:47.744
I didn't know at all!

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.850
It was a bold decision!

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.030
Thank you very much!

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.140
It's a wonderful story.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.310
In this story, there are only six members of the club.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.150
The members of the basketball club and the coach who participated in the national

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.630
tournament appear.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.250
Originally, the basketball club had a large number of members.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.170
In the first month after entering the university, the teachers told me to drop out

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.270
of the class.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.330
I was worried about what would happen in the future.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.990
So I quit the club.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.950
Only six members remained.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.210
A small basketball club with a large number of members that no one expected.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.450
The coach made a secret plan to face Kyogo High School with six members.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.550
Here it is.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.990
HASHIRANAI BASKETBALL At first, everyone was like, what is this?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.790
Manager Wanaka has finally gone crazy.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.530
But I can't say it.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.210
It was like that at first, but I got used to it.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.290
Now I'm used to it and it's our basketball.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.590
It's okay to broadcast.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.630
We play HASHIRANAI BASKETBALL.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.910
We are doing HASHIRANAI BASKETBALL.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.410
I was expected to participate in the national tournament.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.170
You have too much love for basketball.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.650
Are you going to stop the recording?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.709
Six members participated in the national tournament.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.190
In fact, there was a sign of reformation in the school.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.730
In fact, the board of directors has changed.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.250
A new chairman has been appointed.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.290
Now we are struggling to rebuild the school.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.830
The chairman made a reform.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.890
He made the school a reggae club.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.350
It's sudden.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.030
Reggae suddenly.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.290
It's a very good reggae.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.930
Let's listen to it.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.110
Let's listen to it.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.930
Here it is.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.270
It's a very reggae.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.390
There is also a love song.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.770
Where do you sing?

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.210
It's a love letter.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.250
It's a love letter.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.830
It's a new effect.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.370
I don't know what to do.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.230
What do you think?

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.210
When the chairman changed, we heard that the effect would change.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.190
When I first heard it, I didn't know how to sing.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.870
I don't know if I can sing from here.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.870
I'm worried.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.870
I don't know how to sing.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.810
Reggae is like this.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.030
I don't know the chorus.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.210
I think it's a cool song.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.830
It's a good song.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.910
It's a good song.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.930
Do you all sing?

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.030
We sing during the cleaning time.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.290
Do you all do it?

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.050
We do it.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.070
Didn't you think of putting up the ceiling before that?

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.430
That's right.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.250
If it were me, I would have done it.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.170
I have a beautiful heart.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.770
The school is also doing its best.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.510
In the main story, it is clear that both lives are beyond imagination.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.310
When I go to the bathroom, I put on an umbrella.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.270
It's raining hard.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.150
It's like the entrance of a hotel.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.170
It's like a waterfall monument.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.050
In addition, Overcoming various difficulties like this, All you have to do is get

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.690
stronger.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.510
I've come this far.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.710
There will be more incidents in the basketball club.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.190
KONNO will escape from school.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.370
Five people are too dangerous.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.150
The road to the national tournament that overcame the difficulties.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.010
However, a new wall stands in the way.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.590
Before the national tournament, It's like a preliminary round.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.770
The 28 schools of Kyogo high school will gather.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.410
There is a national tournament.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.110
What happened?

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.510
This is VTR.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.150
What happened to the result?

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.310
It's a small touch.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.510
The conclusion of the studio's great excitement.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.809
Abema TVer is missing.
