00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:21.215
You are honeydew, a sweet melon

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:24.593
At some point, I came to like you

00:00:24.897 --> 00:00:28.830
There are melons all over the world

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.495
But you're special

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:34.935
I don't know why I became interested in you

00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:38.216
I can't see anyone but you anymore

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:42.364
Is it bad to be this much in love?

00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:52.132
Where did we first meet?

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:55.419
On the train, or at the convenience store register?

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.804
Even though you're so cute

00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:02.405
My memory of that moment is blurry

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.784
It's like I've known you forever

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:09.214
Like a vivid memory from a past life

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:12.619
I want to call out to you like we're already close

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:16.071
Somehow, you don't feel like a stranger to me

00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:23.040
How many people does one meet in a lifetime?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.286
Such serendipity

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:30.240
People could fall in love many times

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:33.455
Yet never find their one true love

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.954
That's why I'm convinced this is the real thing

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:43.539
You are honeydew, my favorite

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:46.878
When it comes to fruits, you're the only one for me

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:51.105
Whether everyone else likes it or not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.664
Doesn't matter, it's what I like

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:57.277
Even though you're not that sweet

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.511
And your flesh is a little tough

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll always be crazy about you

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.237
It has a very peculiar flavor

00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:17.674
That you'll either clearly like or dislike

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:21.108
But the gentle and unassuming taste

00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:24.575
Has captured my heart

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:31.447
I tried mentioning you to my best friend

00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:35.109
But I got uninterested reaction

00:02:36.324 --> 00:02:38.661
Well, everybody has their preferences

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:42.058
Strawberry, banana, orange, or mango

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:45.881
Apple, grapefruit, or muscat

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:48.200
There are many choices, but

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:52.169
You are special, nobody can replace you

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:55.413
Full of fresh youthfulness

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:59.646
You're not that famous yet

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.277
You're my favorite and nobody else's

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:05.870
Even though your appearance is ordinary

00:03:06.048 --> 00:03:09.084
And there's nothing particularly remarkable

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:15.726
That's what really draws me to you

00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:22.784
The greenish color somehow reminds me of the sky

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:29.375
You're so cute that I unconsciously smile

00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:36.408
No one's making a fuss about you yet

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:39.979
You're the lady of the fruit world

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.127
Yes, I'd like to keep you all to myself

00:03:47.062 --> 00:03:50.355
You are honeydew, a sweet melon

00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:53.704
At some point, I came to like you

00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:57.905
There are melons all over the world

00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:00.925
But you're special

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.726
You are honeydew, my favorite

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.112
When it comes to fruits, you're the only one for me
