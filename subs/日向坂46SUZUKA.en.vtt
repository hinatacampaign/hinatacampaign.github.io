WEBVTT

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:26.822
I always seemed to see her by chance

00:00:27.138 --> 00:00:30.471
That cute girl on the bus

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.438
Without even knowing who she is,
I fell in love

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.304
Even if I rode at the same time

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:45.070
Sometimes she was there, 
sometimes she wasn't

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:52.037
That alone was enough to make me happy

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:59.903
Then, by chance, 
I saw something shocking on TV

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.343
The girl singing and dancing

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.293
It was her!

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:12.459
Her name is SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:16.076
That's how I found out, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:22.075
I never thought something like this 
could really happen

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.308
Though my love won't come true, 
SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:01:27.527 --> 00:01:30.841
Somehow, I'm happy, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:40.491
From now on,
I'll be cheering for you from this side

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.607
I never imagined 
you'd still be riding the bus

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:55.506
I was really surprised to see you there

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.629
Does everyone else realize?

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:03.296
Blending in among the passengers

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.162
That naturalness must be 
the secret to your popularity

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:18.385
For a moment,
I thought about calling out to you

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:26.389
But I decided to protect your private moment

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:30.540
Your nickname is Suzy (Suzy)

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:34.240
I found out later, Suzy (Suzy)

00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:40.406
Right in front of me 
is a Hinatazaka member

00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:45.489
Now I'm your fan, Suzy (Suzy)

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.057
You're so far away, Suzy (Suzy)

00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:58.905
Even if we meet again someday,
I'll pretend not to know you

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:03.971
I searched for 
all sorts of things about you online

00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:07.671
The origin of your name, Suzuka, 
comes from a circuit

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:11.456
You love highways, 
and your "loser" persona suits you so well

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:15.638
Yeah, I want to know 
even more about you as an Ohisama

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:25.540
Then, by chance, 
I saw something shocking on TV

00:03:25.874 --> 00:03:30.058
The girl singing and dancing

00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:33.472
It was her

00:03:34.668 --> 00:03:36.923
It was her!

00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:41.182
Her name is SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:44.598
That's how I found out, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.916
I never thought something like this 
could really happen

00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:56.199
Though my love won't come true, 
SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:59.782
Somehow, I'm happy, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:08.950
From now on, 
I'll be cheering for you from this side

00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:17.346
I heard it's your first time

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.040
Being the center, is it?

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.229
Hold that pose! It's so cute!
That's good!

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:38.089
Let me take it from all angles!

00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:39.842
Okay, okay, that'll do! Thank you!

00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:40.682
Let's eat!

00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:41.497
Let's eat!

00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:44.401
Anyway, what we talked about earlier...
It would be great, right? A song about Suzuka-san.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:47.948
The MV would be all about Suzuka-san!

00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:50.435
Sounds great! "Suzuka! Suzuka!"

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:54.147
Yeah! We've never had a song like that, right?
-It'll also mention that she's called Suzy!

00:04:54.212 --> 00:04:56.998
Even if it's good, 
would anybody listen to a song like that?

00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:10.413
Don't worry! Look, 
the stage is ready for you!
