03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:28.800
At the beach we went to together,
[Issho ni itta sunahama de]

03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:34.000
I heard the rumor that we both feel the same.
[uwasa ni kiita ryou omoi]

03:58:34.200 --> 03:58:39.800
But I can't make the first move,
[Jibun kara wa ikanai no]

03:58:40.000 --> 03:58:45.200
That's just how girls are, right?
[onna no ko tte sou iu mono deshou]

03:58:46.200 --> 03:58:49.800
You gave me at the graduation 
[Sotsugyoushiki ni moratta]

03:58:50.000 --> 03:58:52.800
A ticket to a future with you
[Kimi to no mirai yuki kippu]

03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:57.000
It’s a signal just for you.
[Anata e no shingou]

03:58:58.000 --> 03:59:01.400
Whether it turns green or red
[Ao ni mo aka ni mo suru ni mo ]

03:59:01.500 --> 03:59:03.000
depends on me, after all
[jibun shidai dakedo]

03:59:03.100 --> 03:59:09.000
If I were Cinderella, what would I do? Tell me.
[Cinderella nara dou suru kana oshiete]

03:59:10.000 --> 03:59:16.800
With a pumping of Shuwari, my feelings start to melt.
[Shuwari to pumping suki ga tokedashiteku]

03:59:17.000 --> 03:59:21.800
The scent of soap rides on the sea breeze.
[Umikaze ni notta sabon no kaori]

03:59:22.000 --> 03:59:24.800
Love is all about timing—
[Koi to wa timing]

03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:28.000
In a single minute, fate can change.
[Ippun de unmei kawaru]

03:59:28.200 --> 03:59:31.000
Not a local, but an express train—
[Kakueki janakute kaisoku]

03:59:31.200 --> 03:59:37.000
Where will it take me, this love train?
[Doko e yuku koi no train]
