00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:37.035
The alarm clock is ringing out loud

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:45.501
Even though it’s still far from the time I need to wake up

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.644
The always worried me thinks (Isn’t this such a trivial thing?)

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:53.374
It’s probably someone’s fault (I'll deal with it myself somehow)

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:57.200
Telling me not to be late (Don’t sweat the small stuff)

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:01.034
They're probably keeping an eye on me.

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:02.900
Once I open my eyes, it all begins

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.851
Another day, the same as yesterday

00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:08.992
A spring-driven gear starts turning

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:11.402
And the creaking sound it makes

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:15.722
Might mean it’s rusted somewhere

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:20.089
Until what age can we keep dreaming?

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:23.606
Is it still okay to not face reality?

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:25.869
Even if I lose the youthful belief

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.552
That hopes will come true,

00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:31.301
I might not even notice it.

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:35.209
Until what age can we keep dreaming?

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.714
Should I just give up already?

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:40.989
If it’s impossible,

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:42.835
Without saying anything,

00:01:43.018 --> 00:01:47.155
Could you tap me on the shoulder?

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:09.493
The town is, as always, unchanged (Just noisy as usual.)

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.365
Unproductive. (People bustling about)

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:17.162
It’s filled with lies.

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.018
Everyone’s hurrying off somewhere,

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.039
Saying they have things to do,

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:24.688
But there’s really nothing that must be done.

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:29.272
Just scrambling for today’s meal,

00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:31.849
To keep living another day.

00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:36.114
Can love be found somewhere?

00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:40.006
Is such happiness just a lie?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.087
Is it true that if you love someone,

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:43.818
They’ll come to your rescue?

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:47.553
Was that rumor I heard long ago a lie?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.557
The trick behind life’s magic

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.830
Was revealed too soon, and I was crushed.

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:57.511
No matter how hard I try from now on,

00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:59.508
No matter what effort I make,

00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:04.130
Will I just end up disappointed someday?

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.368
Until what age can we keep dreaming?

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:12.235
Is it pointless to just keep watching?

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:16.181
Even so, until we can confirm it with our own eyes

00:03:16.332 --> 00:03:19.764
We stubbornly keep believing in the future

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:23.907
Until what age can we keep dreaming?

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.260
Is it still okay to not face reality?

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:31.381
Even if I lose the youthful belief that hopes will come true

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:34.959
I might not even notice it.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.866
Until what age can we keep dreaming?

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:42.588
Should I just give up already?

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.966
If it’s impossible,

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.692
Without saying anything,

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:51.208
Could you tap me on the shoulder?
