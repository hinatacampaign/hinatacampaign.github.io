00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.800
No matter how many people surround you

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:26.484
Don't hesitate

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:30.213
Don't be concerned about anything

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:33.741
Don't back down even a single step

00:00:34.343 --> 00:00:37.459
They heard the rumors and came running

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:41.123
They seem to have their own reasons

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.210
I'm sorry, but since this is 
how I truly feel

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:49.047
No matter what happens, it won't change

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:56.371
So show them your one slash of destiny, 
of your feelings

00:00:56.638 --> 00:01:04.062
Now I'm asking you, can you do it?

00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:12.779
If you love someone, 
try cutting your own heart

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:20.545
Are you ready to endure 
the pain of your emotions?

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.402
The red spray of blood

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:27.921
The love spurting out all at once

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:31.384
From a pulsating heartbeat

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.220
Carry a sword that doesn't rust!

00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:57.624
A cloud of dust that blurs the earth

00:01:57.997 --> 00:02:00.983
You, who know how to use your sword

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:05.036
What do you want to take away from me?

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:08.812
Perhaps you don't even know

00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:16.381
Witness, then, life's fleeting phantom

00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:23.946
See it to the end! 
It's fine to be ruthless

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:32.874
If someone loves you, 
try to give something equal in return

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:40.441
Are you ready to lose 
everything you hold dear?

00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:48.007
An honorable life without regrets 
is also love

00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:56.597
But if you're still going for it, 
carry a sword that doesn't rust!

00:03:12.354 --> 00:03:19.381
So show them your one slash of destiny, 
of your feelings

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:27.607
Now I'm asking you, can you do it?

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:36.222
If you love someone, 
try cutting your own heart

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:43.761
Are you ready to endure
the pain of your emotions?

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.968
The red spray of blood

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:51.022
The love spurting out all at once

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:54.805
From a pulsating heartbeat

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:59.954
Carry a sword that doesn't rust!
