00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:28.021
When I ran as fast as I could,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.670
I felt like something would change.

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:39.103
When I cried as hard as I could,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.226
I felt like everything 
would be understood.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:07.153
The words without love, 
and even that person I disliked—

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:19.048
If you smile, 
it’s like none of it ever happened.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:25.090
With this heart full of lies, I sway,

00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:30.901
There’s no meaning here—this is Tokyo!

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:37.512
There are so many things 
I want to see and do with you,

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:42.139
So wait for me there.

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:47.758
On a morning filled 
with an addictive scent,

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:53.541
I tuck away 
these boundless feelings in my chest.

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:59.992
Even the harsh standards 
I’ve been measured by—

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.642
I’ll carry them to this city.

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:26.474
The day you saved me, 
the weak version of myself—

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:38.106
I’m sure I’ll never forget it, 
no matter how far I go.

00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:07.122
With an express ticket and rhythm,
if I circle this city once,

00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:12.560
I’m sure I’ll return to you soon,

00:03:12.743 --> 00:03:23.880
Feeling like I know everything 
and can meet you again.

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:29.220
On a morning filled 
with an addictive scent,

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:35.070
I laugh, 
pretending I know nothing anymore.

00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:40.036
Those reckless judgments—

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:47.337
I don’t need them anymore, no, I don’t.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:05.668
With an express ticket and rhythm, 
to that city—
