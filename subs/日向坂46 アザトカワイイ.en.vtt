WEBVTT

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.556
I was enticed by you

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.840
(In one glance, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:50.420
I fell in love of my own accord

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:53.913
It's not your fault

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:11.393
Today, I saw you again 
(Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:17.711
No, I guess I was looking for you

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:23.746
So many high school girls there 
(Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:26.414
It was during rush hour

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.581
But you always caught my attention

00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:36.010
The arms of your cardigan

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:38.524
You made them just a little longer

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.922
And the way you clenched your hands

00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:44.784
Was cunningly cute 
(Hey!)

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:48.453
I was completely enticed by you

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.324
(In one breath, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.191
Even your habit of biting your lower lip

00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:56.431
Somehow everything made my heart flutter

00:01:56.673 --> 00:02:00.060
And when you tilted your head

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:02.222
(It knocked me out, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:02:02.406 --> 00:02:06.623
Are you aware that you're being watched?
(Hey!)

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:10.166
I'm already hooked on you

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:26.636
Why do you always catch my eyes 
(Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:32.901
Even though there are 
so many girls in this world

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.359
You don't look like a part-time model 
(Wo-oh, Wo-oo-oh)

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.366
You're just an ordinary person

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.463
But ordinary is what I like

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.746
Even when our eyes meet

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.853
With a puzzled look

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:53.514
You keep on staring at me

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:57.718
And your troubled face

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.491
Is cunningly cute
(Hey!)

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:03.095
Have you been targeting me the whole time?

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:05.173
(Be honest, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:08.403
Has everything not been unconscious, 
but planned all along?

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:11.566
I can't read what's inside your mind

00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:15.198
If I made you sad

00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:17.199
(I'm sorry, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.122
I don't care at all 
whether you've been deceiving me (Hey!)

00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:25.770
I love you

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:31.615
Every gesture and every expression

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:40.652
I've been led around by your intentions

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:45.038
I was completely enticed by you

00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:47.095
(In one breath, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:50.256
Even your habit of biting your lower lip

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.444
Somehow everything made my heart flutter

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.102
And when you tilted your head

00:03:57.317 --> 00:03:59.253
(It knocked me out, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.287
Are you aware that you're being watched? 
(Hey!)

00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.468
I've been hooked by you

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:19.580
I love you!
