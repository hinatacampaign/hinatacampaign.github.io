lyrics: >+
    When the moon and stars dance at midnight

    I leapt over the fence, 
    back into the schoolyard

    Trapped inside the old school building, 
    I screamed

    Begging to be let out, 
    pounding on the glass windows

    Trying to break free, back in those days


    In the present, we lament,

    This can't go on, this can't go on

    and we fought back as adults

    Before we knew it, in the world we hated

    We live with our eyes closed

    And stop resisting

    Yes, what was it that we despised 
    so much, for so long?

    Whether or not we'll make it, from now on

    Let's only pursue what we truly want

    As I understand my surroundings better,
    I don't want to get swept away anymore

    No matter what anyone says, 
    we still won't give up

    Don't be afraid to make mistakes!


    Sprawling myself on the sports ground

    I lie there, waiting for the dawn


    How many more laps must I run 
    to be told I've done well?

    Sweating under the scorching sun

    Was just absurd


    Ah, we think of our tiny, tiny selves

    And how we can't see our future

    Our lives feel meaningless and wasted

    And we become anxious

    But if, once more, 
    we could be reborn as anyone

    The dreams we saw back then

    Even now, we surely can still reach them

    It's never too late to make a decision

    Coming here made me realize, 
    we can do anything

    Our anxiety is our potential!


    Climbing the emergency stairs

    I tried going out to the rooftop

    I saw the dawn so beautiful, 
    it took my breath away

    Our world is so beautiful

    in the shivering wind...


    In the present, we lament

    This can't go on, this can't go on

    and we fought back as adults

    Before we knew it, in the world we hated

    We live with our eyes closed

    And stop resisting

    Yes, what was it that we despised 
    so much, for so long?

    Whether or not we'll make it, from now on

    Let's only pursue what we truly want

    As I understand my surroundings better, 
    I don't want to get swept away anymore

    No matter what anyone says, 
    we still won't give up

    Don't be afraid to make mistakes


    (Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Woh...)

    Even if you're at a loss

    (Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Woh...)

    Live strong!

    (Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Woh...)
