00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:11.620
One day, suddenly the adults said,

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:13.442
"Why don’t you give it a try?"

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.314
What should we do? We're cowards

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:24.288
Of course, the way we are now, 
we know we can't do it (HA-)

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:29.903
But somehow, like accepting a fight,
we nod in agreement

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.500
We had no choice, honest people like us

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:35.821
Surely, we’re being tested,

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:38.875
They think if they force 
impossible tasks on us,

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.488
We’ll definitely give up...

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:49.379
We used to look at the world 
over someone else’s shoulder,

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:53.463
But when your turn comes,

00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:58.018
You can’t pass, that's the rule

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.975
The color you see now,

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:05.213
what color is that?

00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:10.083
It's the color of us biting our lips

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:14.116
and giving everything we've got

00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:21.380
Deep in our hearts, 
we kept whispering it over and over,

00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:28.188
What color is that word?

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:34.909
Someday you’ll see...

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:50.267
The reality is so much bigger 
than the dream we once saw,

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:54.271
We hesitated, we are timid

00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:56.558
"If only we had more time,"

00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.300
We want to make excuses like that (HA-)

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:06.421
Everyone has to cross 
the bridge within themselves,

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:10.450
Come on, let’s cross it, you cowards

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.501
No one would blame you,

00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:15.653
But making excuses is pathetic,

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:18.559
You should just shut up and do it

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:26.358
Better to cry in the front 
than to regret staying in the safe zone,

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:34.733
Even if it hurts, let’s cry in the front

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.718
The color you see now

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:42.275
what color is that?

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:51.155
The color we’ve dreamed of 
many times in tough moments

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:58.149
We’ll make sure our wishes come true,

00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:10.800
What color are our feelings? 
We want to say, "Serves you right!"

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.695
They called it reckless, but

00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:30.891
We can't run away,

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:34.845
In such a vast world,

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:39.296
We sing!

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:43.270
The color you see now,

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:46.437
what color is that?

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:51.428
It's the color of us biting our lips

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:55.486
and giving everything we've got

00:03:55.782 --> 00:04:02.758
Deep in our hearts, 
we kept whispering it over and over,

00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:09.416
What color is that word?

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:17.086
Someday you’ll see
