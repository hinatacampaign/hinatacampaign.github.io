00:00:03.043 --> 00:00:03.919
<i>Huddle.</i>

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:07.016
<i>You can't form a huddle alone.</i>

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:13.475
You have friends by your side, and when 
<i>you look up, your eyes will meet theirs.</i>

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:21.098
<i>The circle has no gaps, 
and nobody is the first or last.</i>

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.139
<i>It feels good.</i>

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.944
<i>You'd want the huddle to last forever.</i>

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:35.065
<i>Ah... I want to make a huddle.</i>

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:39.926
<i>I can already hear the cheers.</i>

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:59.497
Ah, friend, this is where we part ways

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:07.761
I'll go right and you go left, 
let's start walking

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:12.833
towards the different futures we dream of

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:18.197
I'm not ashamed of my tears

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:24.952
The days leading up to today 
prove we can look back without regrets

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:30.623
Until we meet again someday

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:40.726
Under this sky, believe in each other
as we do our best in distant places

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.499
Even though I know I'll have to act tough

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:53.108
I must be the one to say goodbye first, oh

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:58.600
Let's start doing the things 
we want to do that we talked about

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:05.318
There's no way I won't feel lonely 
in the long days ahead, oh

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:10.937
The wind is blowing, the clouds flowing, 
and the first star appears

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:15.008
And I turn my back on the twilight

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:32.215
No matter how many setbacks you may face

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:39.065
You'll never give up on 
the dream from that day

00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:44.418
Ah, that's why I won't run away either

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:54.585
Even if along the way, I fall into 
the chasm between ideals and reality

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.168
What am I looking for?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.972
Who do people think about 
as they live their lives? Oh

00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:12.464
I remember the path I walked

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:19.042
It was so fulfilling 
because you were there, oh

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:24.909
The edge of the night sky 
is whitening, tomorrow is coming

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:28.855
My friend, where are you now?

00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:31.106
Oh, have you seen hope?

00:03:31.463 --> 00:03:34.491
Have you gotten what you wished for?

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.356
We're so close to our goal

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.109
Now let's go back to the place we promised

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:50.845
Even though I know I'll have to act tough

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:57.982
I must be the one to say goodbye first, oh

00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:02.647
Let's start doing the things we want to do that we talked about

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:09.813
There's no way I won't feel lonely in the long days ahead, oh

00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:15.657
The wind is blowing, the clouds flowing, and the first star appears

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.614
And I turn my back on the twilight

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:59.403
<i>The shoulders of friends feel warm.</i>

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:02.794
<i>Meeting the eyes of friends, I feel their kindness.</i>

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:05.091
<i>I run.</i>

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:07.494
<i>I kick.</i>

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:10.143
<i>I rush forward.</i>

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.909
<i>Despite that, the huddle feels gentle.</i>

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:19.328
<i>It will always remain round.</i>

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:32.347
<i>Let's form a huddle again someday!</i>

00:05:35.207 --> 00:05:39.620
<i>Because the cheers will never end!</i>
