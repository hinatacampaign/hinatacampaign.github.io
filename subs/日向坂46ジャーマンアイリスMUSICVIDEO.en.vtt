00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:20.375
In the crowd on the street corner,

00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:24.777
When I feel that I missed something,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.635
"It just wasn't meant to be"

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.483
That's what I tell myself

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:37.036
Even though we both

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.359
Thought we liked each other,

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:45.103
Before graduation came,

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:48.386
Why couldn't we say it?

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.433
Youth is (so fleeting),

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.213
So short-lived,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.660
And what's really important (those things)

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:57.567
Are often overlooked

00:00:57.717 --> 00:00:59.880
If only I'd (stopped right there)

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:01.924
And had the courage (to face it),

00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:06.100
Ah, maybe we'd still be together now.

00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:13.797
German iris—do you remember?

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:18.032
They bloomed alongside the path 
we walked to school,

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:21.998
The delicate purple flowers

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.248
We didn't know their name,

00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.298
So we just called them "violets."

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:34.481
It felt like a little secret between us—

00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:38.748
And every time I remember, it hurts.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.635
Every person, without realizing it,

00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:55.414
would become adults, won't they?

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:58.915
All the things that we didn't know

00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:02.849
Is it really good that we know them now?

00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:05.399
First love is (so fragile),

00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.381
It never really bears fruit.

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:09.482
Only after years (have passed)

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:11.548
Do we come to understand.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.482
When I look back (down that path),

00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:15.635
I see you smiling (you are there),

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:19.931
Ah, I want to call out to you—but...

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:27.681
German iris—so many colors exist,

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:31.883
But you and I only knew the purple ones,

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.765
We lived in such a small world.

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:40.297
If only we had known more,

00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:47.432
We wouldn't have misnamed 
those rainbow flowers...

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:12.899
German iris—do you remember?

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:17.048
They bloomed alongside the path 
we walked to school,

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.865
The delicate purple flowers

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:25.182
We didn't know their name,

00:03:25.332 --> 00:03:29.215
So we just called them "violets."

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:33.298
It felt like a little secret between us—

00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:37.331
And every time I remember, it hurts.

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.614
I looked it up in a plant reference book—

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:45.914
The purple flower from that day.
