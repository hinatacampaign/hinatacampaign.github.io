lyrics: >+
    In this world, as many stars as there are,

    There are just as many men,
    but where do I compromise?

    Chasing ideals only leads to heartbreak

    I'd rather have modest happiness


    Finally, as I grow up, I've learned that

    I need to broaden my horizons


    I don't like men 
    who are popular with girls

    Rather than attractiveness, 
    not getting hurt is more important

    If the competition is fierce, 
    I can't relax

    I'd rather have someone 
    I can have all to myself

    Even if he's just an 
    ordinary face in the crowd


    I used to think love was 
    about being swept off my feet

    And working hard for it, 
    but I'm exhausted


    More than that, whenever I turn around,

    someone who's always there

    That's the kind of man I want


    If I can find just 
    one person like that in this world

    Someone kind who loves only me

    Looks don't matter,
    what's inside is what's important

    It's easier without any rivals

    I like the face-in-the-crowd type, 
    wo, wo, wo

    I finally realized it, 
    wo, wo, wo


    Someone who stirs jealousy in others

    I don't need a perfect man like that

    But someone who's always close to me

    I love you!


    I don't like men 
    who are popular with girls

    Rather than attractiveness, 
    not getting hurt is more important

    If the competition is fierce, 
    I can't relax

    I'd rather have someone 
    I can have all to myself

    Even if he's just an 
    ordinary face in the crowd
