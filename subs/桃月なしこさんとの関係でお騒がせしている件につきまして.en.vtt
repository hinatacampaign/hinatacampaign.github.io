00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.200
Yesterday, I had a lot of things to do.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.680
After that, I participated in 
Nashikotaso's online autograph session.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.750
Can I even say Nashikotaso's name...

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.980
Nashikotaso has a calendar book.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.950
If you buy several books,
you can get an autograph.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
And in your birthday month, 
she'll write a birthday message for you.

00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:34.940
There's something like that.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.620
I saw that and I thought 
I definitely wanted it.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.460
So I bought it.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.220
And yesterday, I participated 
in the online autograph session.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.400
You can see it in the archive.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
If you missed it, you can watch it
as many times as you like.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.980
I repeated it many times.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.440
I said I was nervous, 
but I thought it was cute!

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.070
You know...

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.700
I'm really a Nashikko.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.080
I love Nashikotaso so much.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.666
Nashikotaso must have 
written "Manamo â™¥" for me!

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.190
I'm looking forward to getting it soon!

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.033
I'll never forget the 
greatness of Nashikotaso.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.930
Her name is Momotsuki Nashiko.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.820
Can I brag a little?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.230
I've known the origin of "Momotsuki"
in her name for some time.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.880
I saw the birth of the Momotsuki part
in real time back then.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.910
But it's not good.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.580
I shouldn't be like this.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.480
You shouldn't be someone like me.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.109
Nashikotaso doesn't 
want you to be like this.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.820
I know it's not good.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.330
But she's become so popular.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.230
I don't want anyone to think I only 
liked her after she became popular.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.410
I've always loved Nashikotaso.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.640
I really want to say that.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.420
I'm so embarrassed.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.400
I shouldn't be like this.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.760
I shouldn't be a fan like this.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.400
Everyone is great.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.710
Everyone who supports her is great.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.820
You shouldn't be like this.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.311
You have to support your idols properly!

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.190
You have to get along 
with others who support them too!

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920
You have to support them
with all your might!

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.470
That's right.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.340
That's right.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.620
I want to support Nashikotaso together 
with you and someday collaborate with her.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.660
Let's collaborate!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.410
Let's meet in person!

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.160
Anything is fine.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.440
If anyone related to her 
is watching this Showroom,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.620
Please tell Momotsuki Nashiko-sama...
Uh... well...

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.410
Look, I get it. 
I shouldn't do this as a fan.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.400
You think so, right?

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.540
I know.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.930
But I'm an idol!

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.110
I'm an idol.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.110
I've been told that I'm abusing 
my position, but I'm an idol.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.090
I can't help it. I want to abuse it!

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.540
No, it's really...

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.920
But...

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.540
It's okay, isn't it?
