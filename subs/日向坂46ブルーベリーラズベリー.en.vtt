00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.367
Standing still just before the crossing,

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.067
You were about to say something.

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:56.317
With just that, what you're about to say,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.184
Why is it that I already know?

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.234
Even though I realize how much I love you,

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:07.035
I can’t bring myself to confirm it.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.367
With just six months until graduation,

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:14.434
The countdown has already begun.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:21.241
Even if the wind’s speed stays the same,

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.672
Just a slight change in direction 
can alter everything

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:34.991
Tell me how things 
will be different "from now on"

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:42.087
Blueberry &amp; Raspberry – 
I never really looked closely.

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:49.236
We seem alike, 
yet we’re nothing alike at all.

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:56.036
Blueberry &amp; Raspberry – 
that’s what we called each other,

00:01:56.236 --> 00:02:00.868
Not quite friends, not quite lovers—

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:07.953
That’s how I wanted us to stay.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:21.770
The express train rushes past with a roar,

00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:24.419
I can’t just turn this into a memory.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.857
How much more do we need 
to show each other our hearts

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:31.753
Before we can truly believe?

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:38.936
In my dreams, 
it feels like forever will never end.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.153
Even if you smile back at me, 
my chest still tightens.

00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:52.553
The moment I said "I'm sorry," 
it would all be over.

00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:59.570
Blueberry OR Raspberry – 
which one should I choose?

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:06.503
Either way, the tears will fall.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.502
Blueberry OR Raspberry – 
I just want you to be happy.

00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:25.087
Goodbyes, farewells—
none of it reaches us anymore.

00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:42.096
This love, between the similar 
yet different, is everything to me

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:49.053
Blueberry &amp; Raspberry – 
I never really looked closely.

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:56.019
We seem alike, 
yet we’re nothing alike at all.

00:03:56.337 --> 00:04:03.020
Blueberry &amp; Raspberry – 
that’s what we called each other,

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:08.053
Not quite friends, not quite lovers—

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.070
That’s how I wanted us to stay.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.920
I love you!
