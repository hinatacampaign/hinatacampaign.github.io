00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:04.560
Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, How did I know?

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:08.288
Impression, Impression, The moment we met

00:00:08.512 --> 00:00:11.987
A love alert resounds in my chest

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:15.648
The future is a spontaneous choice

00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:21.367
We will surely... Fall in love

00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:30.795
Oh... Probably right on spot

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:37.545
Oh... I guess that? Go with it

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.649
Hey, there's no way I can explain it

00:00:42.044 --> 00:00:45.398
Without even knowing who you are

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:49.115
You introduced yourself half-heartedly

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.701
With a cold "Nice to meet you."

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:56.177
Can't put a finger on it, 
my heart is electrified

00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:00.024
A dangerous premonition 
runs through my whole body

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.701
I can't just pass by, I stop in my tracks

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.344
I want to get closer, 
but what should I do?

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.300
Wait a second, Lady!

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.885
Saying goodbye here

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:13.790
Would be too disappointing

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.524
Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, 
There's something here

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:21.126
Got a feeling, Got a feeling, 
don’t you feel it?

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:24.743
I got a jolt out of you

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:28.435
You're playing it cool, 
but I wanna love you

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.443
Realizing it's fate, You wanna love me?

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:41.587
Oh... Absolute Sixth Sense

00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:48.970
Oh... Please be good to me, Sixth Sense

00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:52.766
It's like I've known you 
from long ago, or maybe not

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.338
You’re like déjà vu

00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:59.978
With a direct pulse to the heart

00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:03.666
I see through everything

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.582
You don't believe it, do you?

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:07.246
How tonight will turn out

00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:09.923
Care to venture a guess?

00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:15.572
Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, 
It’s not about reason

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:19.388
God says, God says, I can hear it

00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:22.891
It’s Dreaming, surely Dreaming, 
a dream come true

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:26.525
Soon, you'll understand. I wanna hold you

00:02:26.728 --> 00:02:32.389
I'm not lying, You wanna kiss me?

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.101
You wanna kiss me?

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:49.018
Wait a second, Lady!

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:50.799
Saying goodbye here

00:02:50.947 --> 00:02:53.467
Would be too disappointing

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:59.348
Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, 
There's something here

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:03.033
Got a feeling, Got a feeling, 
Don’t you feel it?

00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:06.528
I got a jolt out of you

00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:10.428
You're playing it cool, 
but I wanna love you

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:16.147
Realizing it's fate, You wanna love me?

00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:23.362
Oh... Absolute Sixth Sense

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.603
Oh... Please be good to me, Sixth Sense
