<i>The lyrics seem to represent the younger
and older selves of the same person, so we 
attempted to differentiate between the two.</i>

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:22.657 align:start
Every time someone says something,
I want to say that's not it,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:32.374 align:start
Even if I realize someday that it's a mistake, 
right now please let me do as I please.

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:37.974 align:start
It might be a detour, but that's 
what youth is all about in the end,

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:47.506 align:start
Always getting hurt by believing, 
and falling into self-loathing.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.473 align:end
"But that's okay, 
you'll understand when you grow up,"

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.789 align:end
I want to say that to my younger self, 
who was troubled back then.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.505 align:end
Did my voice reach?

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.139 align:end
My true shout...

00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:17.638 align:end
Not drowned out by the city's noise
but carried by the wind...

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:21.221 align:end
Did it reach you?

00:01:21.404 --> 00:01:26.187 align:end
My unmuffled feelings,

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:30.176 align:end
like contrails across the pure blue sky,

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:36.342 align:end
are footprints going straight ahead.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:53.408 align:start
Stubborn and all alone, it's as if 
I've strayed away from everyone,

00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:03.607 align:start
At which crossroad did I take the wrong path? 
I keep looking back over and over.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.190 align:end
Everybody has foolish experiences

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.623 align:end
I want to tell that to myself in the mirror

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.190 align:end
Will my voice reach?

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:25.822 align:end
There's something I want to tell you,

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.189 align:end
If you listen closely, I've been 
shouting it out all along,

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:36.905 align:end
It will surely reach,

00:02:37.088 --> 00:02:41.722 align:end
I've repeated it so many times,

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.755 align:end
Even if rain clouds suddenly cover the sky,

00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:52.238 align:end
It must be clear in the falling rain...

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:11.287 align:start
"You lose something in exchange for freedom"

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:19.520 align:start
I want to run away from such preachy talk

00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:24.920 align:start
Where is the voice coming from?

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:28.520 align:start
It always seems to reach me,

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:36.169 align:start
On sleepless nights, it only rustles 
the trees in the forest of my heart...

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:39.618 align:end
Did my voice reach?

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:43.334 align:end
My true shout...

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:50.784 align:end
Not drowned out by the city's noise
but carried by the wind...

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.384 align:end
Did it reach you?

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.316 align:end
My unmuffled feelings,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.439 align:end
like contrails across the pure blue sky,

00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:09.330 align:end
are footprints going straight ahead.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.933
That voice is

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:21.243
our footprints...
