00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.663
I've always wanted to get to know you, 
Masutani-san!

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.494
Even walking near you like this, 
I can feel your cool vibes!

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:10.259
Cool? You think so?

00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:14.593
Would you be so kind as 
to go with me on this free day? Please?

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:17.818
You don't have to ask like that. 
I don't mind going with you.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.343
Hurray!

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.054
Does it make you that happy?

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:24.660
This is my chance to befriend you, 
Masutani-san!

00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:27.825
Well, that depends on how today goes.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:30.144
It's going to be great, 
since I'll do my best!

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.357
Is that so?

00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:33.076
Ayanocchi?

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:36.465
Yume-chan?

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.893
It's been awhile! How are you?

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.310
What a coincidence! 
You should've told me you're coming!

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:47.194
I'm on a school trip...

00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:48.377
I see...

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.776
Ummm... How did you know each other?

00:00:51.144 --> 00:00:54.810
I'm Mitsutake Yumeka, Ayanocchi's friend 
from when she lived here!

00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:58.260
Wow, a real Tokyoite! 
I'm Hanasato Miyuki, nice to meet you!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.775
Likewise!
