    <i>Huddle.</i>

    <i>You can't form a huddle alone.</i>

    <i>You have friends by your side, and when 
    you look up, your eyes will meet theirs.</i>

    <i>The circle has no gaps, 
    and nobody is the first or last.</i>

    <i>It feels good.</i>

    <i>You'd want the huddle to last forever.</i>

    <i>Ah... I want to make a huddle.</i>

    <i>I can already hear the cheers.</i>


    Ah, friend, this is where we part ways

    I'll go right and you go left, 
    let's start walking

    towards the different futures we dream of

    I'm not ashamed of my tears

    The days leading up to today 
    prove we can look back without regrets


    Until we meet again someday

    Under this sky, believe in each other
    as we do our best in distant places


    Even though I know I'll have to act tough

    I must be the one to say goodbye first, oh

    Let's start doing the things 
    we want to do that we talked about

    There's no way I won't feel lonely 
    in the long days ahead, oh

    The wind is blowing, the clouds flowing, 
    and the first star appears

    And I turn my back on the twilight


    No matter how many setbacks you may face

    You'll never give up on 
    the dream from that day


    Ah, that's why I won't run away either

    Even if along the way, I fall into 
    the chasm between ideals and reality


    What am I looking for?

    Who do people think about 
    as they live their lives? Oh

    I remember the path I walked

    It was so fulfilling 
    because you were there, oh

    The edge of the night sky 
    is whitening, tomorrow is coming

    My friend, where are you now?


    Oh, have you seen hope?

    Have you gotten what you wished for?

    We're so close to our goal

    Now let's go back to the place we promised!


    Even though I know I'll have to act tough

    I must be the one to say goodbye first, oh

    Let's start doing the things we want to do that we talked about

    There's no way I won't feel lonely in the long days ahead, oh

    The wind is blowing, the clouds flowing, and the first star appears

    And I turn my back on the twilight


    <i>The shoulders of friends feel warm.</i>

    <i>Meeting the eyes of friends, I feel their kindness.</i>

    <i>I run.</i>

    <i>I kick.</i>

    <i>I rush forward.</i>

    <i>Despite that, the huddle feels gentle.</i>

    <i>It will always remain round.</i>

    <i>Let's form a huddle again someday!</i>

    <i>Because the cheers will never end!</i>
