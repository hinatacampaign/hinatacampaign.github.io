00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.158
Is your group leader 
really okay with this?

00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:06.697
I feel sorry for her, 
but this chance doesn't come twice!

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:12.331
I feel that this is our destiny!

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:13.949
Me too!

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:17.830
We were so troubled when 
Shiori got into a different homeroom!

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:21.897
What great timing that the four of us
are here in Tokyo on launch day!

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:25.399
Nothing matters right now 
other than getting them!

00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:29.964
We definitely have to get 
all four T-shirt variants!

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:32.014
Here's the plan.

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:34.714
First, Akane, you'll go to Shinjuku.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.164
Wakana, you get Harajuku.

00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.914
Moe, you go to Ueno.

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:39.171
And I'll go to Ikebukuro.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.204
It'll be great if we could 
get all four designs for all of us,

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:44.865
but I want to have at least one!

00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:47.015
Let's do our best!

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.632
Until we meet again...

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:49.848
Disperse!
