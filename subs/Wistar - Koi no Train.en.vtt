03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:28.000
At the beach we went to together,
Issho ni itta sunahama de

03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:34.000
I heard the rumor that we both feel the same.
uwasa ni kiita ryou omoi

03:58:34.500 --> 03:58:39.500
But I can't make the first move,
Jibun kara wa ikanai no 

03:58:40.000 --> 03:58:44.500
That's just how girls are, right?
onna no ko tte sou iu mono deshou

03:58:46.500 --> 03:58:49.500
You gave me at the graduation 
Sotsugyoushiki ni moratta

03:58:50.000 --> 03:58:52.500
(a ticket to a future with you)
(kimi to no mirai yuki kippu)

03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:57.000
It’s a signal just for you.
Anata e no shingou

03:58:58.000 --> 03:59:01.000
Whether it turns green or red
Ao ni mo aka ni mo suru ni mo 

03:59:01.500 --> 03:59:03.000
(depends on me, after all)
(jibun shidai dakedo)

03:59:03.100 --> 03:59:09.000
If I were Cinderella, what would I do? Tell me.
Cinderella nara dou suru kana oshiete

03:59:10.000 --> 03:59:16.500
With a fizzy pumping, my feelings start to melt.
Shuwari to pumping suki ga tokedashiteku

03:59:17.000 --> 03:59:21.500
The scent of soap rides on the sea breeze.
Umikaze ni notta sabon no kaori

03:59:22.000 --> 03:59:24.500
Love is all about timing—
Koi to wa timing

03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:28.000
In a single minute, fate can change.
Ippun de unmei kawaru

03:59:28.500 --> 03:59:31.000
Not a local, but an express train—
Kakueki janakute kaisoku

03:59:31.500 --> 03:59:37.000
Where will it go, this love train?
Doko e yuku koi no train
