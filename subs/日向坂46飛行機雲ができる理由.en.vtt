00:00:03.594 --> 00:00:09.811
Like a finger drawing on a canvas of the sky, there's a white contrail.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:20.460
You suddenly asked me how planes fly and how clouds are formed.

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:39.610
I didn't know either, and as I struggled to find an answer,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.342
You quietly said, "Maybe those are the tears of the plane."

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:54.592
We thought we were (endlessly) under a clear sky,

00:00:54.943 --> 00:01:02.092
That there were no clouds of sadness (or rain) anywhere.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.091
That's what we believed.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:15.841
Although you're always smiling, could it be that one day I'll turn around and find you crying?

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:23.274
I began to feel uneasy about that possibility.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.639
A contrail forms without the plane realizing it,

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:40.624
Maybe that's why this scenery looks so inexplicably sad.

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:45.539
Ah...

00:01:54.122 --> 00:02:00.705
As the wind blew through, your long hair swayed, and you gently held it down.

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:08.871
I think you somehow felt the fluttering in your heart.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:15.771
If you can't say (forever) that you love me,

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:29.204
What should we (oh, what should we) believe in as we move forward?

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:36.936
I was self-deceiving, thinking only I hadn't lost anything.

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:44.437
Even if I asked, "Do you love me?" I probably wouldn't get an answer.

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:51.802
Could it be that there's something that doesn't even resemble happiness?

00:02:51.919 --> 00:03:01.870
Still, I wish to fly in this sky with you.

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:06.534
Ah...

00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:18.834
When I look up at the sky from the ground, I can see the contrails,

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:22.801
But I can't hear the sound of the engine at all.

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:26.166
You're further away than I thought, crying,

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:34.250
I'm sorry I couldn't even reach out to you.

00:03:36.284 --> 00:03:43.433
Although you're always smiling, could it be that one day I'll turn around and find you crying?

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:50.833
I began to feel uneasy about that possibility.

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:58.367
A contrail forms without the plane realizing it,

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:08.382
Maybe that's why this scenery looks so inexplicably sad.

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:20.947
Ah...
