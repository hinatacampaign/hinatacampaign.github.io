lyrics: >+
    A friend of mine said

    They saw you with another guy

    You looked pretty close,

    Chatting so animatedly

    So I told them,

    "Things like that happen."

    He's probably your 
    best friend's boyfriend

    I wasn't really bothered by it


    Come to think about it, 
    come to think about it, I remember

    That weekend, that weekend, 
    you said you had a dentist appointment

    Isn't that strange? Isn't that strange? 
    Who were you with?

    "Are you cheating on me?"

    I only asked jokingly,


    But you

    threw a Halloween pumpkin at me!

    You got seriously mad at me

    Even slightly doubting you is awful

    The pumpkin is smashed against the wall

    Shattered, like our love

    I didn't think you'd get that angry...

    Sorry, but what about our Halloween plans?
