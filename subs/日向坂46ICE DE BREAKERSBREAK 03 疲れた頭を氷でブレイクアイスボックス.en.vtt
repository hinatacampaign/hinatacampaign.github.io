00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.066
One minute remaining!

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:06.568
I don't know this one...

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:09.101
Another one detected!

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.200
So it's him today...

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.763
For An Exhausted Mind,
Ice de Break!

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:28.956
Are you stumped?

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:30.663
You need to refresh!

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.169
Here you go!

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.940
I'm in the middle of a test!

00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:39.917
If it's four choices,
I usually guess 3!

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:41.343
I'd go with 2!

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:42.947
The middle ones, huh...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.010
Time's up!

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.137
Hand in your papers!

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:50.642
For an exhausted mind,
Ice de Break!

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.870
Today, a target facing trouble
in his schoolwork

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.290
has been wonderfully helped
by the Ice de Breakers duo!

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.089
What did you pick for the last question?

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:01.108
I answered 1!

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:02.152
I knew it!

00:01:02.392 --> 00:01:03.748
So it was 1...

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:09.882
Seriously?

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:13.616
Is this love?
