lyrics: >+
    Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, How did I know?

    Impression, Impression, The moment we met

    A love alert resounds in my chest

    The future is a spontaneous choice

    We will surely... Fall in love


    Oh... Probably right on spot

    Oh... I guess that? Go with it


    Hey, there's no way I can explain it

    Without even knowing who you are

    You introduced yourself half-heartedly

    With a cold "Nice to meet you."

    Can't put a finger on it, 
    my heart is electrified

    A dangerous premonition 
    runs through my whole body

    I can't just pass by, I stop in my tracks

    I want to get closer, 
    but what should I do?


    Wait a second, Lady!

    Saying goodbye here

    Would be too disappointing


    Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, 
    There's something here

    Got a feeling, Got a feeling, 
    don't you feel it?

    I got a jolt out of you

    You're playing it cool, 
    but I wanna love you

    Realizing it's fate, You wanna love me?

    Oh... Absolute Sixth Sense

    Oh... Please be good to me, Sixth Sense


    It's like I've known you 
    from long ago, or maybe not

    You're like déjà vu

    With a direct pulse to the heart

    I see through everything

    You don't believe it, do you?


    How tonight will turn out

    Care to venture a guess?


    Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, 
    It's not about reason

    God says, God says, I can hear it

    It's Dreaming, surely Dreaming, 
    a dream come true

    Soon, you'll understand. I wanna hold you

    I'm not lying, You wanna kiss me?

    You wanna kiss me?


    Wait a second, Lady!

    Saying goodbye here

    Would be too disappointing


    Sixth Sense, Sixth Sense, 
    There's something here

    Got a feeling, Got a feeling, 
    Don't you feel it?

    I got a jolt out of you

    You're playing it cool, 
    but I wanna love you

    Realizing it's fate, You wanna love me?

    Oh... Absolute Sixth Sense

    Oh... Please be good to me, Sixth Sense
