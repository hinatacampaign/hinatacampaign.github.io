    At a cheap Thai restaurant near the school
    I found you, looking 
    a bit mature in a chic dress
    I kept my distance 
    to avoid the sweet ache in my heart
    I drank something non-alcoholic
    so I could keep my composure
    I wanted to smile at you

    It's our first reunion in five years
    So many nostalgic faces
    Who'd been in love with whom?
    As I recall my memories, 
    I'm embarrassed to answer that question

    "I don't remember you"
    I forced myself to say it
    But the truth is, I haven't forgotten you
    If after all this time, 
    I confessed that I'm in love with you
    Wouldn't I look so lame?
    "I don't remember you"
    I said while avoiding your eyes
    I'll just have to live with the sadness
    I might have heard a rumor you got a boyfriend
    After all, we weren't classmates

    Many months and years have passed,
    and we've all changed
    But our youth remains frozen in time 
    from when we walked by each other in the breezeway
    You're the only one who hasn't changed

    Now that we've graduated
    Each one of us has a story to tell
    I heard that the school building
    Will be torn down next year or so

    I remember so vividly
    The love I kept in my heart
    I was always watching you from afar
    You don't know that, do you?
    I remember even now
    That smile of yours
    Flipping through my yearbook
    To the next page
    I don't know how many times I've done so

    Now, even though we're so close by
    We don't exchange a single word
    I keep pretending that I don't remember you
    But actually I still love you

    I remember!

    "I don't remember you"
    I forced myself to say it
    But the truth is, I haven't forgotten you
    If after all this time, 
    I confessed that I'm in love with you
    Wouldn't I look so lame?
    "I don't remember you"
    I said while avoiding your eyes
    I'll just have to live with the sadness
    I might have heard a rumor you got a boyfriend
    After all, we weren't classmates
