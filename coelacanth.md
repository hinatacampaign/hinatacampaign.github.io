    I felt a drop of rain on my cheek
    
    From within the crowd, 
    I looked up to the sky

    When I thought I was done for

    Suddenly a umbrella was
    held out for me from behind

    I wondered who it was and turned around

    But it was a woman I didn't know


    Her gaze felt familiar from somewhere

    Why does this feel nostalgic? Who are you?


    Like coelacanth, the living fossil

    It was there at the bottom of my heart

    Emotional moments like this 
    that I've forgotten for so long

    Nothing has changed since those times

    I rediscovered the excitement

    I can't believe that it's been 
    quietly living until now, such a miracle

    Was it in middle school? Or high school?

    It was so long ago, 
    the pain of being in love

    If I tried to talk to her

    Something might suddenly happen


    I ran toward a café canopy

    And she took shelter right next to me

    Why are you here, 
    even though you have an umbrella?

    This was weird, such a strange feeling

    But somehow, I didn't feel bad at all

    I wished the rain would never stop falling


    How long have we stood here in silence?

    Why is my heart thumping? What's going on?


    The coelacanth survived to this day

    It didn't go extinct

    Nobody noticed it, 
    where could it have been?

    It didn't succumb to the glacial period 
    of adulthood, nor to natural selection

    It was just forgotten and 
    now it has reappeared, such a mystery


    I thought I lost this a long time ago

    This feeling that's so important to me

    I rediscovered it deep within my heart

    It made me kind of happy


    Like coelacanth, the living fossil

    It was there at the bottom of my heart

    Emotional moments like this 
    that I've forgotten for so long

    Nothing has changed since those times

    I rediscovered the excitement

    I can't believe that it's been 
    quietly living until now, such a miracle

    Was it in middle school? Or high school?

    It was so long ago, 
    the pain of being in love

    If I try to talk to her

    Something might suddenly happen
