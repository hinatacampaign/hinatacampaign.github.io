lyrics: >+
    I always seemed to see her by chance

    That cute girl on the bus

    Without even knowing who she was,
    I fell in love

    Even if I rode at the same time

    Sometimes she was there, 
    sometimes she wasn't

    That alone was enough to make me happy


    Then, by chance, 
    I saw something shocking on TV

    The girl singing and dancing

    It was her!


    Her name is SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    That's how I found out, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    I never thought something like this 
    could really happen

    Though our love won't come true, 
    SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    Somehow, I'm happy, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    From now on,
    I'll be cheering for you from this side


    I never imagined 
    you'd still be riding the bus

    I was really surprised to see you there

    Does everyone else realize?

    Blending in among the passengers

    That naturalness must be 
    the secret to your popularity


    For a moment,
    I thought about calling out to you

    But I decided to protect your private moment


    Your nickname is Suzy (Suzy)

    I found out later, Suzy (Suzy)

    Right in front of me 
    is a Hinatazaka member

    Now I'm your fan, Suzy (Suzy)

    You feel so distant, Suzy (Suzy)

    Even if we meet again someday,
    I'll pretend not to know you


    I searched for 
    all sorts of things about you online

    The origin of your name, Suzuka, 
    comes from a circuit

    You love highways, 
    and your "loser" persona suits you so well

    Yeah, I want to know 
    even more about you as an Ohisama


    Then, by chance, 
    I saw something shocking on TV

    The girl singing and dancing

    It was her

    It was her!


    Her name is SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    That's how I found out, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    I never thought something like this 
    could really happen

    Though our love won't come true, 
    SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    Somehow, I'm happy, SUZUKA (SUZUKA)

    From now on, 
    I'll be cheering for you from this side


    I heard it's your first time

    Being the center, is it?
