lyrics: >+
    On the mahogany table, 
    rewriting the letter over and over again

    Tonight, as always, 
    my only ally is milk tea

    How long have I been 
    thinking about that person?

    Even the moon in the night sky 
    must have been watching me


    Closing my eyes, biting my lips, 
    searching endlessly

    For an exit hidden deep 
    within the fog of my heart


    Whenever I have sleepless nights, 
    I always wonder why I love you so much

    Your smile, your gestures, 
    your voice, and even your back

    Dozens, no, hundreds of times, 
    I’ve imagined the same things

    And so, until the night breaks

    Yawning, I write my love letter


    From the hem of the antique curtains
    spills the sunrise

    I wanted to confess, but I ran out of time

    Surely, I could never love anyone else

    Even the little birds nearby 
    chirp in agreement


    Lying on a bed without a single wrinkle

    With just the lingering warmth 
    of the wood stove, I feel happiness


    When sleep finally comes, I’ll 
    unknowingly dream of my wishes fulfilled—

    Strolling with arms linked, 
    down an avenue of trees on the weekend

    Sitting on a bench somewhere

    All the feelings I’ve kept hidden 
    until that day

    I'll gently reveal them in a love letter


    Anyone who falls in love loses sleep, 
    don’t they?

    How many more long winters must pass?


    Whenever I have sleepless nights, 
    I always wonder why I love you so much

    Your smile, your gestures, 
    your voice, and even your back

    Dozens, no, hundreds of times, 
    I’ve imagined the same things

    And so, until the night breaks

    Yawning, I write my love letter
