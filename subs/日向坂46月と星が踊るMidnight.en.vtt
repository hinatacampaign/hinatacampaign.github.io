00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:23.615
When the moon and stars dance at midnight

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.288
I leapt over the fence, 
back into the schoolyard

00:00:31.634 --> 00:00:38.555
Trapped inside the old school building, 
I screamed

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Begging to be let out, 
pounding on the glass windows

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:49.504
Trying to break free, back in those days

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.074
In the present, we lament,

00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:54.797
This can't go on, this can't go on

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.912
and we fight back as adults

00:00:57.338 --> 00:01:00.105
Before we knew it, in the world we hated

00:01:00.223 --> 00:01:01.601
We live with our eyes closed

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:04.604
And stop resisting

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:09.313
Yes, what was it that we despised 
so much, for so long?

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.703
Whether or not we'll manage, from now on

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:14.790
Let's just do what we really want to do

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:18.983
As I understand my surroundings better,
I don't want to get swept away anymore

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:27.956
No matter what anyone says, 
we still won't give up

00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:31.886
Don't be afraid to make mistakes

00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:43.670
Sprawling myself on the sports ground

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:51.245
I lie there, waiting for the dawn

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:58.698
How many more laps must I run 
to be told I've done well?

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:05.646
Sweating under the scorching sun

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:10.103
Was just absurd

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.665
Ah, we think of our tiny, tiny selves

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.025
And how we can't see our future

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.530
Our lives feel meaningless and wasted

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:24.478
And we become anxious

00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:29.228
But if, once more, 
we could be reborn as anyone

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:31.631
The dreams we saw back then

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.742
Even now, we surely can still reach them

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.991
It's never too late to make a decision

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:47.915
Coming here made me realize, 
we can do anything

00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:51.130
Our anxiety is our potential

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:54.431
Climbing the emergency stairs

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:58.119
I tried going out to the rooftop

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:05.378
I saw the dawn so beautiful, 
it took my breath away

00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:12.786
Our world is so beautiful

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:18.667
in the shivering wind...

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:24.703
In the present, we lament

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.598
This can't go on, this can't go on

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.940
and we fight back as adults

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.848
Before we knew it, in the world we hated

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:33.499
We live with our eyes closed

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:36.359
And stop resisting

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:41.159
Yes, what was it that we despised 
so much, for so long?

00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.468
Whether or not we'll manage, from now on

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:46.697
Let's just do what we really want to do

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:50.519
As I understand my surroundings better, 
I don't want to get swept away anymore

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:59.873
No matter what anyone says, 
we still won't give up

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:02.992
Don't be afraid to make mistakes

00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:08.922
(Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Woh...)

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.197
Even if you're at a loss

00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:15.909
(Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Woh...)

00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:19.232
Live strong

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.721
(Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Woh...)
