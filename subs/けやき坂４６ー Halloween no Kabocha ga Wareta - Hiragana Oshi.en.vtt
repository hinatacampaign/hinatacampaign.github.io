A friend of mine said

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:22.152
They saw you with another guy

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.402
You looked pretty close,

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.448
Chatting together

00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:32.967
So I told them,

00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:36.687
"Things like that happen."

00:00:36.863 --> 00:00:40.986
He's probably your 
best friend's boyfriend

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.664
I wasn't really bothered by it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.222
Come to think about it, 
come to think about it, I remember

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:50.910
That weekend, that weekend, 
you said you had a dentist appointment

00:00:51.098 --> 00:00:54.692
Isn't that strange? Isn't that strange? 
Who were you with?

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.474
"Are you cheating on me?"

00:00:56.597 --> 00:01:00.352
I only asked jokingly,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.722
But you

00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:05.068
threw a Halloween pumpkin at me!

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:08.880
You got seriously mad at me

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:14.737
Even slightly doubting you is awful

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:19.798
The pumpkin is smashed against the wall

00:01:19.928 --> 00:01:23.383
Shattered, like our love

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:29.332
I didn't think you'd get that angry...

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:40.013
Sorry, but what about our Halloween plans?
