    One day, suddenly the adults said,

    "Why don’t you give it a try?"

    What should we do? We're cowards

    Of course, the way we are now, 
    we know we can't do it (HA-)

    But somehow, like accepting a fight,
    we nodded in agreement

    We had no choice, honest people like us

    Surely, we’re being tested,

    They think if they force 
    impossible tasks on us,

    We’ll definitely give up...


    We used to look at the world 
    over someone else’s shoulder,

    But when your turn comes,

    You can’t pass, that's the rule


    The color you see now,

    what color is that?

    It's the color of us biting our lips

    and giving everything we've got

    Deep in our hearts, 
    we kept whispering it over and over,

    What color is that word?

    Someday you’ll see...


    The reality is so much bigger 
    than the dream we once saw,

    We hesitated, we are timid

    "If only we had more time,"

    We want to make excuses like that (HA-)

    Everyone has to cross 
    the bridge within themselves,

    Come on, let’s cross it, you cowards

    No one would blame you,

    But making excuses is pathetic,

    You should just shut up and do it


    Better to cry in the front 
    than to regret staying in the safe zone,

    Even if it hurts, let’s cry in the front


    The color you see now

    what color is that?

    The color we’ve dreamed of 
    many times in tough moments

    We’ll make sure our wishes come true,

    What color are our feelings? 
    We want to say, "Serves you right!"


    They called it reckless, but

    We can't run away,

    In such a vast world,

    We sing!


    The color you see now,

    what color is that?

    It's the color of us biting our lips

    and giving everything we've got

    Deep in our hearts, 
    we kept whispering it over and over,

    What color is that word?

    Someday you’ll see
