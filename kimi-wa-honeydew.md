lyrics: >+
    You are honeydew, a sweet melon

    At some point, I came to like you

    There are melons all over the world

    But you're special

    I don't know why I became interested in you

    I can't see anyone but you anymore

    Is it bad to be this much in love?


    Where did we first meet?

    On the train, or at the convenience store register?

    Even though you're so cute

    My memory of that moment is blurry

    It's like I've known you forever

    Like a vivid memory from a past life

    I want to call out to you like we're already close

    Somehow, you don't feel like a stranger to me


    How many people does one meet in a lifetime?

    Such serendipity

    People could fall in love many times

    Yet never find their one true love

    That's why I'm convinced this is the real thing


    You are honeydew, my favorite

    When it comes to fruits, you're the only one for me

    Whether everyone else likes it or not

    Doesn't matter, it's what I like

    Even though you're not that sweet

    And your flesh is a little tough

    I'll always be crazy about you


    It has a very peculiar flavor

    That you'll either clearly like or dislike

    But the gentle and unassuming taste

    Has captured my heart


    I tried mentioning you to my best friend

    But I got uninterested reaction

    Well, everybody has their preferences

    Strawberry, banana, orange, or mango

    Apple, grapefruit, or muscat

    There are many choices, but


    You are special, nobody can replace you

    Full of fresh youthfulness

    You're not that famous yet

    You're my favorite and nobody else's

    Even though your appearance is ordinary

    And there's nothing particularly remarkable

    That's what really drew me to you


    The greenish color somehow reminds me of the sky

    You're so cute that I unconsciously smile

    No one's making a fuss about you yet

    You're the lady of the fruit world

    Yes, I'd like to keep you all to myself


    You are honeydew, a sweet melon

    At some point, I came to like you

    There are melons all over the world

    But you're special


    You are honeydew, my favorite

    When it comes to fruits, you're the only one for me

    Whether everyone else likes it or not

    Doesn't matter, it's what I like

    Even though you're not that sweet

    And your flesh is a little tough

    I'll always be crazy about you
