00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:26.886
When did we start to become aware of it?

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:31.507
Where does this slope lead us?

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:38.375
Those who came before us aimed their steps

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.582
Toward the promised land for dreamers.

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:53.878
Looking like an upturned silver cup,
a landmark is there.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:04.110
The shape of the shining future 
is a giant egg. WOW...

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:08.568
Will you wait for us 
until our dream comes true?

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:12.569
We’ll take you with us.

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:20.590
Even if it’s harsh, we won’t give up.
Believe in us, oh.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:28.280
High-fiving and hugging each other,
And wiping tears of joy.

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:35.253
With such moments in mind,
Let’s move forward.

00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:42.320
Our bond is to be there.

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:48.362
Would you tell us it's impossible?

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:52.565
Would you tell us that it can't be done?

NOTE Paragraph

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:56.265
Would you tell us to abandon hope?

00:01:56.535 --> 00:02:00.273
Would you tell us to give up?

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:04.090
Living without dreams has no meaning.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.035
I’ll keep pushing myself 
with a promise of “tomorrow.”

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.127
To reach the goal with our own steps,

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:15.985
Let’s make a promise here and now

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:20.162
Distant dreams give us courage.

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:23.997
Together, let’s walk

00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:33.802
And reach that place, side by side.
