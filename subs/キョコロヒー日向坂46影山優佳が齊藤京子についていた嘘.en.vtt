00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:08.555
Yesterday was the 
beginning of the World Cup.

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:12.159
So today we'll do a World Cup special.

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:21.855
How often is the World Cup held?

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.748
Every four years.

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:26.609
Every four years? Like the Olympics?

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:29.612
We should be more enthusiastic about this!

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.400
It's best to keep looking forward.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.330
Many TV Asahi programs already had 
the cast wearing the blue uniforms,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.084
So we only have the 
goalkeeper colors left for you.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.091
Even if you said that,
we're not disappointed or anything.

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:52.026
We don't even know what you meant
by "goalkeeper colors".

00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:57.071
Friend of yours?

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.051
Yes... Uh, I mean...

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:02.793
We've known each other for 7 years
and joined our group at the same time.

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:05.931
Kageyama's the top of mind 
if you're talking about "soccer idols".

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:06.661
Thank you!

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.371
I see...

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:09.181
Do you play soccer yourself?

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:11.861
Yes, I've played since I was 5 years old.

NOTE Paragraph

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:16.803
Kageyama-san, what kind of relationship 
do you have with Saito-san?

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.406
Our relationship...

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:23.223
I'm told that I'm good 
at explaining things to others,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.940
and I can also control Kyoko's mind.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.062
That's a scary thing to say!

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:34.523
So you can control her mind?

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:36.418
In a previous "Kyoccorohee" episode,

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:40.689
you talked about how the [8th single] MV
shooting location had many frogs, right?

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:45.094
At the time, I was the one 
who explained about the frog ecology.

00:01:45.094 --> 00:01:45.975
Yes, yes!

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:51.786
So you explained about the frog ecology
and made her feel better?

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:55.785
She said because of their ecology, 
frogs only gather in certain areas.

00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:58.015
Kageyama protected me in that way.

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:00.741
How is that mind control?

00:02:00.752 --> 00:02:01.542
Uh...

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.133
It was all a lie.

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.301
What's going on here?

00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:13.722
I didn't know anything 
about the frog ecology.

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:15.956
So you lied about that?

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:17.556
You're pretty slow on the taking!

00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:21.486
It was weird that you didn't react sooner!

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:22.401
Hang on, hang on...

00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:25.172
I didn't understand what she 
meant by "it was all a lie"!

00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:29.290
She said her explanation about 
frog ecology was all a lie!

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.210
But the spot Kageyama pointed to
really didn't have frogs on it!

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:36.873
Well, that was just a coincidence.

NOTE Paragraph

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:39.175
Then I really was mind controlled by her.

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:41.303
That's how our relationship is like.
