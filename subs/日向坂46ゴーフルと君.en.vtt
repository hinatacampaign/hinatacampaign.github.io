00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:21.828
What do you think?

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:25.819
Actually...

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:32.734
Actually, it's the best thing ever!
Right, Mikuni?

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.262
Yeah, I almost cried a little!

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:38.435
Me too! It's the ultimate love story 
between unaging people!

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:40.504
It's really moving!

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:42.253
Really? Thanks!

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.872
Is it okay that I based them on you?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.938
It's totally fine!

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:47.630
If anything, thank you for that!

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:48.569
Thank you!

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:49.401
Seriously...

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:53.312
Hey, isn't it so cool when 
Mikuniro said "Go and be happy"?

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:58.062
The part where Hinano 
runs like crazy to help him is also good!

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:01.442
May I see this?

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:02.496
Hey, wait...

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:05.296
You drew this yourself?

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:06.182
Yeah.

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:08.088
It's good, isn't it?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.864
But there are 
many people who are this good.

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:13.134
What did you say?

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:15.969
No, I mean...

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:17.660
I guess you're right.

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:29.345
Haruyo...

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.537
Sorry.

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:34.046
You shouldn't apologize to us!

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.506
Excuse me...

00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:12.525
Excuse me...

00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:42.571
Somehow, I couldn't remember 
for the longest time

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.398
It had been swept away 
by the passing months and years

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:53.194
On a Sunday afternoon, with the blue sky 
visible through the window

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:58.536
I'm sipping a cup of Earl Grey,
lost in thought

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.426
It was such an important time for me

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:08.161
Yet I forgot about it so easily

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.589
It's a pastry called 'gaufre'

00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:14.437
Round and thin, 
originally from France

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:19.664
A baked delicacy
with a waffle-like uneven texture

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:24.526
I loved it so much, yet I couldn't even
remember the name right away

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:30.895
Maybe I'm blocking it out, 
so it won't remind me of you

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:37.050
You loved the crunchy texture

00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:42.795
The light sweetness 
and the buttery flavor

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.414
How it never fills you up 
no matter how much you ate

00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:53.019
That's what you always said 
as you reached out for another one

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:57.810
Without understanding the meaning
of love or kindness

00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:02.654
Before I knew it, I had grown into an adult

00:04:02.948 --> 00:04:08.891
I suddenly have a craving for gaufres, 
even though I haven't had any since

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:14.193
I don't know why, 
it can't just be nostalgia

00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:19.096
Falling in love with someone 
is something you realize all of a sudden

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.449
You're just living your everyday life, 
and the feeling just hits you

00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:50.646
As I was eating the gaufre, 
crumbs of it fell under the table

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:53.056
Somehow even those pieces felt so precious

00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:55.615
Everything I saw back then 
was irreplaceable

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.120
I understand it now

00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:03.389
It's not about who you fell in love with, 
it's how you felt at the moment

00:05:03.622 --> 00:05:07.636
What you haven't forgotten 
is what's truly important

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:10.999
It's a pastry called 'gaufre'

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.686
Round and thin,
originally from France

00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:19.014
A baked delicacy
with a waffle-like uneven texture

00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:23.919
I loved it so much, yet I couldn't even 
remember the name right away

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:30.513
Maybe I'm blocking it out, 
so it won't remind me of you

00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.431
One, two... Go!

00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:42.144
We wish that this manuscript be accepted!

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:43.419
Wanna go home?

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:44.697
Let's go!

00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:48.053
Where should we go today?

00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:50.893
Haruyo's place!

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:53.379
Good idea!

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:54.616
It's a bit chilly today.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.383
It is! I don't wanna be outside!

00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:59.558
Let's have fun! Got any new games?
