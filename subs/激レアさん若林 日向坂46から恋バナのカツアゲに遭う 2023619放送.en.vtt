00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.920
Geki-rare (Extremely Rare) Unreleased Talk!

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.511
First, Hinatazaka46 member Kato Shiho will talk about

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:13.640
what she wants to do with Wakabayashi-san after graduating from the group!

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.577
Kato-san! It's your first time on this show!

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:17.400
Nice to meet you!

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.140
Nice to meet you, too!

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.333
Kato-san, you're been doing another show
with Wakabayashi-san for some time.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.377
Yes, that's right.

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.730
What kind of relationship do you have?

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.266
Relationship?

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.777
We're doing a late-night Hinatazaka46 show together!

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.355
I like him!

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.800
I respect him as a person.

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:43.870
After I graduate, I definitely want to go
to Disneyland with him.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.911
Can you really just say that
in front of the camera?

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.360
You'll get in trouble!

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.955
If I say it publicly first, it might not be seen as a bad thing!

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.300
But I don't want to go to Disneyland! -That's terrible!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.020
It'll start all sorts of bad rumors!

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.260
So sad to hear that! It's one of my dreams.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.820
I really respect him, but
it might not have been conveyed.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.440
Wakabayashi-san wouldn't
just believe what I say.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.133
But I've been saying it for years now,
so you believe me, don't you?

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:15.288
I still think it's suspicious!

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.888
You never told me specifically why you respect me!

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.120
Still, I'm grateful.

00:01:22.488 --> 00:01:23.088
I'm sad.

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:24.577
You admire him?

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:27.911
I really like him as a person.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:29.666
Thank you for that.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.533
It's rare to like an entertainer as a person!

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.733
That's right.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.466
I don't get told that much.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.200
You're a diabolical man!

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.333
You're diabolical!

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.888
It's strange that you laugh while saying that!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.911
If you're serious.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.040
Because this is the Geki-rare version of Wakabayashi-san.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.800
That's right.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.955
Usually we work with a group of women, about 30 people.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.360
While recording that show, he always seems burdened.

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:11.888
I always feel a little darkness from when he enters.

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.511
But today, he seemed so bright outside the studio.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.740
I was surprised.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:20.333
Well, that's the difference between a midnight TV Tokyo and prime-time TV Asahi show!

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:23.400
I'm sorry! -That's the truth!

00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:23.980
I'm sorry...

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.040
That's the truth. I'm even on the poster!

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:29.977
You're just being realistic!

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:31.777
<i>Next...</i>

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.600
Wakabayashi-san told us his love stories!

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:37.600
No way!

00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:42.933
<i>Wakabayashi-san told Hinatazaka his love stories?!</i>

00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:47.680
By the way, Kato, have you ever had a rare experience?

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:51.600
I have. This is also a story about Wakabayashi-san.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.044
I have a bad feeling about this...

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.940
Hinatazaka members and Audrey-san went for dinner together.

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:02.511
In private?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.120
Yes. It's private, isn't it?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.066
It was during a location shooting in Miyazaki!

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.244
It's strange to call it a private dinner!

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.266
There was a rare incident at that time.

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:19.800
Wakabayashi-san told us his love stories!

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.444
No way!

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:22.840
It's very rare, isn't it?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.022
No, no...

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:26.955
They interrogated me for love stories!

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.000
They asked me tell those stories...

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.733
and then they said in other TV shows that 
I told them love stories at a dinner party!

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.580
I was embarrassed!

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.977
That's cute!

00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:42.620
An older comedian telling twenty-something idols his love stories...

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.044
What's the point of that?!

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.890
I didn't know you feel that way! I won't talk about it anymore. -Yes, please stop!

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.733
I'll keep it a secret! -Please do.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.355
Also, while we sat around him, Wakabayashi-san stood in the middle.

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:57.577
And as he spun around, we checked his skeletal structure.

00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:00.860
That was another rare experience!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.960
No, no, I was forced to do it!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.177
Apparently, idols and models often do skeletal structure evaluation.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280
That's right.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.666
They asked me to stand up and walk around
to examine my skeletal structure.

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:17.111
They made me do the walking in the middle of an izakaya!

00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:21.088
Then they told everyone that I suddenly demonstrated my walking!

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:22.711
It's a scary group!

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:26.688
It was a long time ago.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.488
I think we got along better now.

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:33.290
I want to dig deeper into your past love life. Let's do it again!

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.380
I'll never talk about that again!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.020
It's a good relationship!

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.222
You're like their homeroom teacher.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.533
The guy everybody teases.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.266
From now on, I'll only talk about the ratings of the program!

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.355
That's scary!

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.488
That hurts...

00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:53.466
<i>Also this week...</i>

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.911
<i>The president of ORDERSUITSADA, who wears bespoke suits while doing reckless challenges, appears!</i>

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.622
<i>For Director Sada, who is always swayed by his subordinates' recklessness...</i>

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.500
<i>Wakabayashi and Kato-san will also propose reckless challenges!</i>

00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:18.444
By the way, as you can see, it's getting heated up.

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:25.377
Let's come up with unthinkable ideas!

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.444
He even went abroad and climbed mountains.

00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:32.488
What would be interesting to do in a suit?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800
What about being tied up and dragged by a horse?

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:37.400
Are we in the Edo period?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400
Like a cowboy! 

00:05:38.955 --> 00:05:44.244
Go to Texas and get dragged by a horse there!

00:05:45.088 --> 00:05:50.311
Then get up and say, "I'm going to a meeting after this! 
Even after being dragged around, no problem!"

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:52.622
So strange!

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.755
What about cheer dance?

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.577
Cheer dance?

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:02.244
Cheer dance is surprisingly hard.

00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:08.022
It needs a lot of physical strength and
leg movements, so it's pretty hard.

00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:13.422
It might be great to take on cheer dance!

00:06:13.688 --> 00:06:15.866
Thank you for the new ideas!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.133
It might be good to try a new direction.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.755
Yes, a cuter direction!

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.466
I want to see Sada-san dancing!

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.733
I will consider it.

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:27.260
Thank you!
