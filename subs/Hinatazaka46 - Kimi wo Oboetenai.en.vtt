00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:23.230
At a cheap Thai restaurant near the school

00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:30.168
I found you, looking 
a bit mature in a chic dress

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:36.836
I kept my distance 
to avoid the sweet ache in my heart

00:00:37.147 --> 00:00:43.418
I drank something non-alcoholic
so I could keep my composure

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:46.981
I wanted to smile at you

00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:51.110
It's been five years since we last met

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.753
It's been a long time 
since we've seen each other

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:58.580
Who's been in love with whom?

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:04.454
As I recall my memories, 
I'm embarrassed to answer that question

00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:06.487
"I don't remember you"

00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:08.474
I forced myself to say it

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.838
But the truth is, I haven't forgotten you

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:15.334
After all this time, 
I can't believe I'm still in love with you

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.815
Isn't it lame to say that?

00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:20.495
"I don't remember you"

00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:22.249
I said while avoiding your eyes

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.522
I'll just have to live with the sadness

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:32.179
I heard a rumor you got a boyfriend

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.710
Who was in another class

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.808
Many months and years have passed,
and we've all changed

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:56.564
But our youth remains frozen in time 
from when we walked by each other in the breezeway

00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:00.137
You're the only one who hasn't changed

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:04.274
Now that we've graduated

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:07.759
Each one of us has a story to tell

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:11.032
I heard that the school building

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:17.443
Will be torn down next year or so

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:21.361
I remember so vividly

00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:24.853
The love I kept in my heart

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:28.357
I was always watching you from afar

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:31.819
You don't know that, do you?

00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:35.231
I remember even now

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:38.419
That smile of yours

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:42.836
Flipping through my yearbook

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:45.107
To the next page

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:51.895
I don't know how many times I've done so

00:02:57.134 --> 00:03:00.311
Now, even though we're so close by

00:03:00.493 --> 00:03:03.603
We don't exchange a single word

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:06.799
I pretend that I don't remember you

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:10.405
But actually I still love you

00:03:15.364 --> 00:03:17.026
I remember

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:18.623
"I don't remember you"

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.543
I forced myself to say it

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.954
But the truth is, I haven't forgotten you

00:03:24.043 --> 00:03:27.463
After all this time, 
I can't believe I'm still in love with you

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.739
Isn't it lame to say that?

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.691
"I don't remember you"

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.433
I said while avoiding your eyes

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.992
I'll just have to live with the sadness

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:44.388
I heard a rumor you got a boyfriend

00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:51.022
