00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:06.290
Mommy, you're my rival...

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:21.605
De-wa, de-wa, de-wa, 
de-wa, de-wa, de-wa, da-da-da.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.193
Hey, can I borrow your pink dress?

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:29.087
It's for my first date with him.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:32.634
You were the 
prettiest girl in high school,

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:36.928
The dress you used to wear back then, Mom.

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:45.305
You once nostalgically 
told me a love story

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:53.228
About how you and Dad fell in love 
under the starry night at a dance party.

00:00:53.656 --> 00:01:00.436
The car horn honked three times, 
my boyfriend has come to pick me up.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.663
I spun around in front of the mirror—
do I look pretty now?

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:23.202
Tu, lu, tu, tu, tu, 
tu, lu, tu, tu, lu, lu.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.587
Hey, Mom, can I borrow your lipstick?

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.440
I want to look a little more grown up.

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:34.057
Your hairstyle, your make-up...

00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:37.911
Let me copy you from head to toe,

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:45.479
So I can make all the boys fall for me.

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:48.012
You're my rival,

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.335
So I have to go beyond my genes.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:02:09.155
De-wa, de-wa, de-wa, 
de-wa, de-wa, de-wa, da-da-da.

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:16.453
In the old graduation photo, 
there's a girl who looks just like me.

00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:24.563
The cutest one with the ponytail—
it's you, right, Mom?

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:31.839
I wasn't the one 
who opened the front door,

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.940
And for a second, my boyfriend 
was confused—you looked way too young.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:54.540
Tu, lu, tu, tu, tu, 
tu, lu, tu, tu, lu, lu.

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:59.655
We're like sisters. 
Lend me that pink dress.

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:03.457
It was tucked away 
in the back of the closet.

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:11.328
The design's pretty old-fashioned, 
but it's still stylish, and I like it.

00:03:11.528 --> 00:03:18.357
Yeah, it's the kind of dress 
that'll make anyone turn their head.

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:26.328
I'll follow in your footsteps, Mom, 
and one day, I'll find someone like Dad.
