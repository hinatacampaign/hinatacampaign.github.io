00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.340
I felt a drop of rain on my cheek

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.850
From within the crowd, 
I looked up to the sky

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.180
When I thought I was done for

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.218
Suddenly a umbrella was
held out for me from behind

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:47.596
I wondered who it was and turned around

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:53.102
But it was a woman I didn't know

00:00:53.461 --> 00:01:00.488
Her gaze felt familiar from somewhere

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:06.222
Why does this feel nostalgic? Who are you?

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:10.771
Like coelacanth, the living fossil

00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:14.472
It was there at the bottom of my heart

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:21.416
Emotional moments like this 
that I've forgotten for so long

00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:24.568
Nothing has changed since those times

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:28.367
I rediscovered the excitement

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:35.836
I can't believe that it's been 
quietly living until now, such a miracle

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.391
Was it in middle school? Or high school?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.509
It was so long ago, 
the pain of being in love

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:46.188
If I tried to talk to her

00:01:46.484 --> 00:01:53.290
Something might suddenly happen

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.297
I ran toward a café canopy

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:13.651
And she took shelter right next to me

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:20.182
Why are you here, 
even though you have an umbrella?

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.102
This was kind of weird, such a strange feeling

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:28.890
But somehow, I didn't feel bad at all

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:33.996
I wished the rain would never stop falling

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:41.392
How long have we stood here in silence?

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:47.186
Why is my heart thumping? What's going on?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.524
The coelacanth survived to this day

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:55.313
It didn't go extinct

00:02:55.616 --> 00:03:02.342
Nobody noticed it, 
where could it have been?

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.282
It didn't succumb to the glacial period 
of adulthood, nor to natural selection

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:16.673
It was just forgotten and 
now it has reappeared, such a mystery

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:33.278
I thought I lost this a long time ago

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:37.089
This feeling that's so important to me

00:03:37.377 --> 00:03:41.041
I rediscovered it deep within my heart

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:46.769
It made me kind of happy

00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.399
Like coelacanth, the living fossil

00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:56.204
It was there at the bottom of my heart

00:03:56.545 --> 00:04:03.427
Emotional moments like this 
that I've forgotten for so long

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.750
Nothing has changed since those times

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.147
I rediscovered the excitement

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:17.557
I can't believe that it's been 
quietly living until now, such a miracle

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.134
Was it in middle school? Or high school?

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:25.270
It was so long ago, 
the pain of being in love

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:27.971
If I try to talk to her

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:35.579
Something might suddenly happen
