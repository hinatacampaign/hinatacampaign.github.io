00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.852
I can't find the answer,

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.092
Which way is the exit?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.395
If you're looking for me, I'm right here.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.861
Here, here, here,

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:30.325
Here, here.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:33.647
Like faint moonlight carving out a path,

00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:42.349
We grope our way through 
the pitch-black road, moving forward.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.467
Past midnight, sneaking out of the house,

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:54.334
We agreed to meet 
on the hill overlooking this town.

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:59.901
We can't see anything,

00:01:00.142 --> 00:01:03.242
But I can feel it for sure,

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:08.318
Love is right beside us.

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:15.159
Even if a monster 
we've never seen before appears,

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:21.750
Don't ever run away from there.

00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:27.443
The terrifying things are just illusions,

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:33.886
Testing the promises we made.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.268
Do we move forward anyway, or turn back?

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:44.998
So, will you put your trust in me?

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:52.192
Here, here, here,

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:57.009
Here, here.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:03.060
The rustling trees can't 
just be from the wind, can they?

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:08.926
Am I the last person left in this world?

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:15.209
Even if anxiety deep inside 
blocks our way,

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:21.034
Without stopping, 
let's run straight through it.

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:26.397
Something's coming into view,

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:29.843
A silhouette of a ponytail.

00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:35.120
It might be just an illusion,

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:42.048
But even if the scariest monster 
blocks our way,

00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:48.425
Close your eyes and think of me,

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:53.982
Because I'll be thinking of you.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:03:00.576
Before long, all those distracting 
thoughts will surely disappear.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.691
Do you still love me? 
Of course, I love you.

00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:12.230
We should be able to meet very soon.

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.621
Even if a monster 
we've never seen before appears,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:49.079
Don't ever run away from there.

00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:54.850
The terrifying things are just illusions,

00:03:55.068 --> 00:04:01.303
Testing the promises we made.

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:07.422
Do we move forward anyway, or turn back?

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:12.171
So, will you put your trust in me?
